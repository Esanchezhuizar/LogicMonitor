The modified code is a Python script that makes an API call to the LogicMonitor platform to retrieve data for a specific device and data source. The script uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the LogicMonitor REST API with the necessary parameters and headers, including authentication information.

Before sending the request, the script constructs a signature using the Access Key, request details, and the current time in milliseconds. It then encodes the signature in Base64 and adds it to the Authorization header along with the Access ID and epoch time. The script then sends the request to the specified URL and prints the response status and body to the console.

The modification made to the original code is that after 3000 devices, the script generates an API call to retrieve data for a specific device and data source.
